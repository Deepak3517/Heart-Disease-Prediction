# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in a person using machine learning and provides an easy to use interface built with Streamlit. The goal is to support early risk assessment using medical attributes such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, ECG results, heart rate, and more.
